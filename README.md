# Visualize voting trends with more than 20 years of U.S. election data

This talk explores various approaches to visualizing voting trends in U.S. presidential elections from 2000-2024 using an interactive web map. The app allows users to view election results from year to year using animations and composite multivariate symbols. I’ll introduce a map style that combines results from multiple elections into a single symbol, making it easy to see how support for a political party grew, shrunk, or maintained constant support over time in various regions of the United States. I’ll summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each visualization approach and propose when each visualization style is appropriate for specific audiences and situations.
